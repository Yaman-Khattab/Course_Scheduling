Dear Amazon Team

Please find the website in the folder inside.

IMPORTANT NOTE:

* Genetic Algorithm is fully implemented and it works just fine
* The website is working but i didn't manage to integrate my genetic algorithm script which is written by python to my Website which is written by Django because of SQLite
* Sqlite have different commands to fetch the database in python from Django (Django use Models)
* You can find the workable verison of genetic algorithm in the file called "Genetic Algorithm", the not workable one is integrated in views.py in the website
*I hope you guys like it
